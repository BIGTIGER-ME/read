  <p>The researchers tested the spread of a test virus in two bathrooms after a flush. The virus was one not able to infect humans. They flushed one bowl with the lid up, and another with the lid down. After a minute, they used a sponge to swab the surfaces in the toilet. They concluded that there were no significant statistical differences in the quantities of the virus in the two bathrooms. They added that the results "demonstrate that closing the toilet lid prior to flushing does not mitigate the risk of contaminating bathroom surfaces, and that disinfection of all restroom surfaces may be necessary after flushing or after toilet-brush use" to cut the spread of germs. They also said it was important to disinfect the water in the bowl.</p>
